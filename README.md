the json for my academic bent twitter bot

it is hosted on http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/
and has been created using the tracery library for json and the visual editor http://www.brightspiral.com/tracery/

you are welcomed to add to it's vocabulary and syntax

as of current version, it mostly refers Baudrillard's theories, as well as some philosophical thought experiments. 
it reflects on gender and identity, in an age of networks.

I wish for it to conflates scholarly concepts and public figures.
